1. **Strategi for rekruttering og sammensetning:** *Anbefalinger for å bemanne prosjektgruppen, med vekt på å balansere behovet for mangfold (ulike teamroller som produksjon, administrasjon, integrasjon, entreprenørskap) med behovet for en viss grad av sosial og demografisk likhet for å fremme tidlig tillit. Dere må forklare hvorfor dette er viktige momenter å ta inn i planleggingen tidlig.*

## Design av "det første møtet
A central part of the projects´ starting phase is to establish a mutual understanding of the goals, roles and working processes within the team. In addition, it is important to facilitate relationship building between the members, as the group consists of people with different backgrounds and professions. The very first meeting should therefore be designed with a clear agenda that makes way for information sharing, joint reflection among the members and so- called pseudo- work, meaning activities and conversations that are not directly related to the project, but which contribute to developing trust, interaction and cooperation in the group. During the first meeting, instead of talking directly about the upcoming project, is one encouraged to talk, and even brag, about former projects. These irrelevant conversations are crucial in order to build and develop their first impressions on each other, according to Jacobsen (2016). 

These first meetings are important for planning, setting standards and expectations. In practice, all projects- depending on their size- should allocate time for so- called kickoff meetings. These meetings serve as a crucial arena for planning and for initiating the first clarifications of expectations between the project members. Jacobsen (2016) also pointed out the importance of the first meeting, which he meant would provide the foundation for subsequent collaboration and successful implementation. There are 3 points which are needed in order to have an effective kickoff meeting; Task orientation, team orientation, and the earlier mentioned, pseudo- work. 

A suitable and professional agenda may begin with a short welcome and introduction by the project manager, followed by a round of participant presentations. The meeting should then move on to a thorough review of project goals, boundaries, and success criteria, ensuring that everybody develops a common understanding of the main goals. There should also be small breaks every now and then to allow informal dialogues. 

When it comes to the early phase a project, planning and structuring are essential to establish clarity about what should be done, when, and how. Planning can be understood as an attempt to anticipate the future in order to align expectations among participants, and research consistently shows that time invested in systematic planning yields significant benefits later in the project (Jacobsen, 2016). Nevertheless, many studies indicate that little time is often devoted to planning in the initial stages. A central reason for this is the strong sense of time pressure inherent in most projects, which are typically defined by clear deliverables and fixed deadlines. Time pressure can often lead to a tendency to rush toward future goals, with the present activities seen as less important. Erling has 15 months and 8 million NOK to finish the project. He, therefore, must invest some time and money to make way for a smooth and immaculate delivery of the application. 



3. **Rammer for relasjonelle kontrakter:** *Anbefalinger for utforming av kontrakter eller mandater som ikke bare fokuserer på "jerntriangelet" (tid, kostnad, kvalitet), men også på relasjonelle forhold og hvordan samarbeidet mellom prosjekteier og prosjektleder skal foregå.*



4. **Proaktive mekanismer for konflikthåndtering:** *Forslag til konkrete ordninger og prosedyrer for å identifisere, drøfte og avgjøre uenigheter tidlig i prosjektet, for å unngå eskalering.*



5. **Håndtering av tidspress og "planleggingsfellen":** *Råd til prosjektlederen om hvordan man kan motvirke det sterke handlingspresset i tidlig fase og balansere behovet for en klar plan med fleksibilitet.*



6. **Sikring av god kommunikasjon:** *Råd og anbefalinger som prosjektlederen kan benytte for å sikre en god og e^ektiv kommunikasjon i teamet.*
